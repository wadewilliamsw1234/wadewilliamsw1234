# Hi, I'm Wade👋
### Roboticist in Training | Applied Math @ Dartmouth | Former Investment Analyst @ Blackstone 

I’m a **former investment analyst** turned **roboticist**, passionate about making **fun robots** and **useful AI agents**. My career began in the world of finance, interning at **The Blackstone Group** and **Amherst Holdings**, where I **analyzed potential real estate investments**. During my time **in finance**, I noticed a **recurring issue**: talented, brilliant people **wasting time on repetitive, mundane tasks**. With a strong **love for robotics and engineering** and my **applied math** background from **Dartmouth**, **I decided I wanted to contribute to solving this problem**. My goal? 
**To create fun robots and useful AI agents that automate repetitive, boring digital and physical tasks, hoping to inspire and enable people to spend more time on work that fulfills them.**



## 🚀 About Me
- **Background:** Former real estate finance at Blackstone and Amherst.
- **Currently:** Dedicating my time to building fun robots and useful AI agents.
- **Mission:** Striving to automate repetitive, boring tasks and make the world more fun.



## 🌟 What I'm Up To

- 🌱 **Building & Learning** - Helping small companies ditch repetitive, mundane tasks with custom AI agents and automation solutions, while expanding my robotics skillset through fun projects (see "Working On" below).
- 📖 **Reading** -  Diving into books on robotics, AI, and automation. Currently reading Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control and Robot-Proof.
- 📝 **Writing** - Writing has become my most relied-upon method for learning and growing. I write in order to learn what I think about what I don't yet understand. I was never the student to speak up in seminar classes, though I believed my thoughts were valuable. As I dive into robotics, I’m documenting my journey openly, to clarify my own understanding and to encourage others to share their ideas.
