# Hi, I'm Wade
### Roboticist in Training @ Northeastern | Applied Math @ Dartmouth | Former Investment Analyst @ Blackstone 

I’m a **former investment analyst turned roboticist**, passionate about **making fun robots** and **useful AI agents**. My career began in the world of finance, interning at The Blackstone Group** and Amherst Holdings, where I analyzed potential real estate investments. During my time **in finance, I noticed a recurring issue: talented, brilliant people wasting time on repetitive, mundane tasks**. With a strong love for robotics and engineering and my applied math background from Dartmouth, I decided **I wanted to contribute to solving this problem**. My goal? 
**To create fun robots and useful AI agents that automate repetitive, boring digital and physical tasks, hoping to inspire and enable people to spend more time on work that fulfills them.**

<br>

## 🚀 About Me
- **Background:** Former real estate finance at Blackstone and Amherst.
- **Currently:** Dedicating my time to building fun robots and useful AI agents; incoming M.Sc. Robotics candidate at Northeastern.
- **Mission:** Striving to automate repetitive, boring tasks and make the world more fun.

## 🌟 What I'm Up To

- 🌱 **Building & Learning** - Helping small companies eliminate repetitive, mundane tasks with custom AI agents and automation solutions, while expanding my robotics skillset through fun projects (see "Working On" below).
- 📖 **Reading** -  Diving into books on robotics, AI, and automation. Currently reading [Introduction to Robotics: Mechanics and Control](https://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics#Online_Courses), [AI Engineering](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-engineering/9781098166298/), and [Learning Robotics Using Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-robotics-using/9781783287536/).
- 📝 **Writing** - Writing has become my most relied-upon method for learning and growing. I write in order to learn what I think about what I don't yet understand. I was never the student to speak up in seminar classes, though I believed my thoughts were valuable. As I dive into robotics, I plan to document my journey openly, to clarify my own understanding and to encourage others to share their ideas.
