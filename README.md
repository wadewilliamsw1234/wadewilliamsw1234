# Hi, I'm Wade👋
### Roboticist in Training | Applied Math @ Dartmouth | Former Investment Analyst @ Blackstone 

I’m a **former investment analyst** turned **roboticist**, passionate about making **fun robots** and **useful AI agents**. My career began in the world of finance, interning at **The Blackstone Group** and **Amherst Holdings**, where I **analyzed potential real estate investments**. During my time **in finance**, I noticed a **recurring issue**: talented, brilliant people **wasting time on repetitive, mundane tasks**. With a strong **love for robotics and engineering** and my **applied math** background from **Dartmouth**, **I decided I wanted to contribute to solving this problem**. My goal? 
**To create fun robots and useful AI agents that automate repetitive, boring digital and physical tasks, hoping to inspire and enable people to spend more time on work that fulfills them.**


## 🚀 About Me
- Former real estate finance at Blackstone and Amherst
- Currently dedicating my time to building fun robots and useful AI agents
- Striving to automate repetitive, boring tasks and make the world more fun 


## What I'm Up To

- 🌱 **Creating & Learning** - I'm currently helping small companies build AI agents and automation solutions to streamline repetitive, time-consuming tasks, while expanding my robotics skillset through fun projects (see "Working On" below), books, and writing articles.
- 📖 **Reading** -  Currently exploring books on robotics, AI, and automation, such as *Robot-Proof* by Joseph Aoun and *The Master Algorithm* by Pedro Domingos.
- 📝 **Writing** - Writing has become my most relied-upon method for learning and growing. I write in order to learn what I think about what I don't yet understand. I was never the student to speak up in seminar classes, though I believed my thoughts were valuable. As I dive into robotics, I’m documenting my journey openly, to clarify my own understanding and to encourage others to share their ideas.
