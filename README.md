Before starting my graduate studies at **Northeastern University**, my academic and professional journey centered around full-stack development while also exploring diverse areas of research and technology. During my **undergraduate years**, my coursework focused heavily on **full-stack development**, and I applied these skills to projects at **Wenzhou University of Technology**, **Wenzhou Bopu Institute of Big Data**, and **MIE DEMO Studio**. Notable achievements included **public opinion analysis**, **data-driven research**, and developing a **volunteer management platform**, which was recognized as a **national innovation project**.  

After graduation, I worked as a **Technical Manager** and **Project Leader** at **Zhejiang Chongxiao Zhong Han Medical Technology Co.**, where I led full-stack development projects. Key contributions included creating a **VC++-based database integration tool** and a **Springboot+Vue electronic invoice management system**, achieving an **80% improvement in operational efficiency**.  

Alongside my primary focus on full-stack development, I also explored other areas such as **sentiment analysis**, **knowledge graph construction**, and **user behavior modeling**, broadening my technical expertise and research interests.  

In the early phase of my graduate studies, I joined the **CHATS Lab** at Northeastern University, where I worked on **chatbot-related projects**, contributing to advancements in conversational AI systems.
