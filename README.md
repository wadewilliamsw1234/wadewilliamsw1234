# Hi, I'm Wade👋
### Roboticist in Training | Applied Math @ Dartmouth | Former Investment Analyst @ Blackstone 

I’m a **former investment analyst** turned **roboticist**, passionate about making **fun robots** and **useful AI agents**. My career began in the world of finance, interning at **The Blackstone Group** and **Amherst Holdings**, where I **analyzed potential real estate investments**. During my time **in finance**, I noticed a **recurring issue**: talented, brilliant people **wasting time on repetitive, mundane tasks**. With a pre-existing strong **love for robotics and engineering** and my **applied math** background at **Dartmouth**, **I decided I wanted to be a part of solving this problem**. My goal? 
**To create fun robots and useful AI agents with the purpose of automating repetitive, boring digital and physical tasks to inspire and enable people to spend more time doing work that fulfills them.**


## 🚀 About Me
- Former real estate finance at Blackstone
- Dedicating my time to making fun robots and useful AI agents
- Striving to automate repetitive, boring tasks and make the world more fun 


## What I'm Up To

- 🌱 **Creating & Learning** - I'm currently helping small companies build AI agents and automation solutions to automate repetitive, time-consuming tasks, while expanding my skillset to robotics through fun projects (see working on), books, and writing articles.
- **Reading** -  
- 📝 **Writing** - Writing has become my most relied upon method for learning and growing. I write in order to learn about what I don't yet understand. I was never the student to speak up in a seminar class, even though I believe my thoughts were valuable, but as I dive into robotics, I'm documenting my journey and progress openly, to clarify to myself what I do and don't understand and to give people the courage to share their thoughts.
